# Introduction 

This project services as an example of how a RESTful web service should be structured using C# and .Net Core as the programming language and core framework. A basic understanding of REST as it applies to web services is useful. Developers should also review https://github.com/Microsoft/api-guidelines as all web services should strive to meet the overall principles presented there.
